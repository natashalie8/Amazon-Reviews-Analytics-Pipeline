# Amazon Reviews Analytics Pipeline

This repository showcases scalable data analytics projects on large Amazon review datasets.  
It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), distributed processing, and machine learning pipelines, leveraging **Python, Dask on AWS EC2**, and **Apache Spark on cluster environments**.

## Highlights
- **EDA at Scale** – summarized reviewer/product behavior across millions of reviews (avg rating ≈ 4.09; long-tail reviewer activity).
- **Distributed Processing (Dask)** – deployed a Dask cluster on AWS EC2 with Jupyter tunneling; optimized pipeline runtime to ~163s.
- **Spark Feature Engineering & ML** – built features from product/review data and trained predictive models using SparseVectors.

## Skills Demonstrated
Python • Dask • AWS EC2 • Spark • Jupyter • Pandas/NumPy • Data Visualization
